This is my second assignment from my Programming Languages Course -- Fall Semester 2020

In the instructions document the instructions provided for the homework are provided.

Within the CICOMParser folder you'll find the main.py to run the parser.

CorrectSyntaxt.txt and SyntaxError.txt are provided to test the parser. They are expected to
return "Syntax is Correct" or throw a syntax error appropriately.
